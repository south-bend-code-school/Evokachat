      <p>This app was created to motivate and encourage others. Our goal is to make people feel better by sending notes and cards to others or yourself. <br> The creators of this app are ELLA, VANESSA, OLIVIA, KATELYN, and ALESSANDRA. Evoka was designed to be used in schools. The required age is junior high and up. Every week we decide on a Bible verse. We call it "Bible Verse of the Week." We are now going to tell you a little about us. We hope that you enjoy our app! EVOKAchat!!!! Thank You. >^.^< <3 </p>
